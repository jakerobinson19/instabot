# instabot

There are several instagram bots available on Github, this one is tailored to the goal of follower growth by applying Gary Vaynerchuks $1.80 strategy of commenting on 90 unique posts everyday. This bot takes the strategy one step further by also liking several of the past photos for accounts that are commented on. Ultimately, the number of comments per day and like per account can by configured by the user.

Mirrored after the Gary Vaynerchuk's $1.80 strategy for follower growth, this instagram bot will automate the task of liking and commenting on instagram pictures. The user will be able to specify the rules of engagement including how many accounts to view, how many pictures of each account to like, and if and what to comment on pictures. 

While a key part of the $1.80 strategy is using comments related to the pictures content, this automated bot can only allow limited customization of comments.

This bot is written in python and requires the use of the web browser automation tool, Selenium.

To install Selenium, enter the commands below (based on your operation system):

###Windows:
pip install selenium

###MacOs:
sudo easy_install selenium
