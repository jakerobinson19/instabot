# instabot

Mirrored after the Gary Vaynerchuk's $1.80 strategy for follower growth, this instagram bot will automate the task of liking and commenting on instagram pictures. The user will be able to specify the rules of engagement including how many accounts to view, how many pictures of each account to like, and if and what to comment on pictures. 

While a key part of the $1.80 strategy is using comments related to the pictures content, this automated bot can only allow limited customization of comments.

This bot is written in python and requires the use of the web browser automation tool, Selenium.

To install Selenium, enter the commands below (based on your operation system):

###Windows:
pip install selenium

###MacOs:
sudo easy_install selenium
